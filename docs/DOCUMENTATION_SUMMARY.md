## Key Documentation Highlights

### Platform Architecture

The PeakNIL platform follows a procedural modular architecture with the following key components:

- **Config**: Contains configuration files for the platform
- **Modules**: Contains the platform's functionality organized into separate modules
- **Auth**: Handles user authentication, registration, and session management
- **Public**: Contains publicly accessible files and assets
- **Database**: Contains database schema and relationship definitions
- **Docs**: Contains documentation files

The platform uses a PHP-based backend with a MySQL database and follows a procedural programming paradigm with a modular structure.

### Database Schema

The database consists of multiple tables organized around the following key entities:

- **Users and Authentication**: Users, roles, levels, login attempts, verification attempts, banned users
- **Profile and Metadata**: User profiles, user metadata, user flags, user addresses
- **Social Media**: User social media, social media stats
- **Business Entities**: Brands, brands users, collectives, collectives users
- **Content and Assets**: Assets, collection main
- **Transactions**: Deals, pricing
- **Schools and Sports**: Schools, sports, positions, pro sports
- **System**: Activity log, email log, API keys, alert messages, landing products, services, workbench activity

The database uses a relational model with relationships defined in the `database/relationships.json` file. The platform does not use FOREIGN KEY constraints, assuming PlanetScale as the database, and manages referential integrity through application code.

### Module System

The platform follows a modular architecture with each module handling a specific aspect of the platform's functionality. Each module follows a standard directory structure:

```
modules/[module_name]/
├── [module_name].php          # Main module file
├── functions/                 # Module-specific functions
│   └── [module_name]_functions.php
└── views/                     # Module views/templates
    └── view.[page_name].php
```

Key modules include:

- **Core Modules**: Common, API
- **Authentication Modules**: Login, Registration, Password Reset, Email Verification
- **User-Facing Modules**: Dashboard, Profile, Settings, Wallet, Marketplace, Landing, Deals
- **Business Modules**: Brands, Collectives
- **Experimental Modules**: Workbench, School Manager, Parent Portal, Data Services, Deal Builder, Campaign Builder, Recruiting, Agency, Financial Literacy, Messenger, Favorites

### Security Features

The platform implements comprehensive security features:

- **Authentication Security**: Secure user registration with email verification, password complexity requirements, account lockout after failed attempts, IP-based login restrictions
- **Session Security**: Session timeout mechanism, session regeneration on login, session fixation protection, IP binding for sessions
- **CSRF Protection**: Secure token generation, token validation for all forms, token validation for AJAX requests
- **XSS Protection**: Input sanitization, output escaping, Content Security Policy headers
- **SQL Injection Protection**: Prepared statements for all queries, parameter binding for user input, input validation
- **Security Headers**: Content-Security-Policy, X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection, Referrer-Policy, Strict-Transport-Security
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against brute force and denial of service attacks
- **API Security**: Secure API access with API key authentication and rate limiting
- **Password Security**: Secure password storage with Bcrypt hashing
- **Email Security**: Secure email communication with logging and verification
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Comprehensive logging of security events and user activities

### API System

The API provides programmatic access to platform data and functionality:

- **RESTful Architecture**: The API follows REST principles, uses JSON for data formatting, and implements secure authentication via API keys
- **MVC Architecture**: The API follows a clean MVC architecture with controllers, services, models, DTOs, middleware, and core components
- **Authentication**: API key authentication, rate limiting, CORS support
- **Endpoints**: Profile endpoint, school endpoint, and additional endpoints as needed
- **Request and Response Format**: Standardized request and response formats, error handling, and response headers
- **API Key Management**: Generating API keys, API key database schema, API key security
- **Integration Examples**: PHP, Python, and JavaScript examples, best practices for API usage
- **Creating New Endpoints**: Step-by-step guide for creating new API endpoints
- **API Versioning**: Version format, version changes, version headers

### Documentation Structure

The documentation is organized to provide a comprehensive understanding of the platform:
