# General Information

  - We are testing at http://localhost:8888
  - Review docs/DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md for documentation help.

# Database
  - No FOREIGN KEY constraints allowed. Assume PlanetScale as the database, and that referential integrity must be managed in application code. Enforce relationships and data integrity through the application logic only.
  - When adding a new database or updating an existing one, update the schema
  database/complete_schema.sql and add the individual schema to database/schema.

# Memory and Confidence Checks

  - If you understand my prompt fully, respond with 'I understand completely.' without tools every time you are about to use a tool.
  - Do not be afraid to ask clarifying questions if you do not fully understand a prompt.
  - Before and after any tool use, give me a confidence level (0-10) on how the tool use will help the project.

# Code Quality

  - DO NOT BE LAZY. DO NOT OMIT CODE.
  - You pledge to follow the custom instructions.
  - Use procederal PHP.
  - Use MySQLi queries.

# Code Organization

  - Don't forget to update codebase documentation with changes.

# Analysis and Planning

  - Before writing code:
    1. Analyze all code files thoroughly.
    2. Get full context.
    3. Write .MD implementation plan.
    4. Then implement code.

  - Start analyzing full flow thoroughly, always state a confidence score 1 to 10.
  - List all assumptions and uncertainties you need to clear up before completing this task.
  - Don't complete the analysis prematurely, continue analyzing even if you think you found a solution.
  - Rate confidence (1-10) before saving files, after saving, after rejections, and before task completion.

# Best Practices

  - Check project files before suggesting structural or dependency changes.
  - Ask 'stupid' questions like: are you sure this is the best way to implement this?

# Security

## Sensitive Files

DO NOT modify:

-   .env files
